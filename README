This project has been discontined. I'm developing a new more powerful for Away3D 4.1, If you want to try it, please contact me.

This is a simple gui editor for the particle system!
how to use :
step 1: open the editor,click import button.
step 2: open any file of example,copy body of the file to the code window of the editor.
step 3: click preview.
step 4: change any propertys of the example and then preview again.

how to use the exported code in your project:
first ,load the exported file, convert it to XML type.
then code as :
	var effect:EffectGroup = EffectGroupFactoryS.createEffectGroup(xml);
	_view.scene.addChild(effect);
	effect.start();
very simple!
